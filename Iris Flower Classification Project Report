Iris Flower Classification Project Report
1. Project Summary
This project involves the classification of Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using machine learning models.
The dataset contains 150 records with 4 numerical features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

The objective is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify a flowerâ€™s species based on its measurements.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Initial visualizations revealed that:

Petal Length and Petal Width are highly effective in distinguishing between species.

Setosa is easily separable from the other two species.

A correlation heatmap showed a strong relationship between Petal Length and Petal Width.

Class balance is perfect: 50 samples per species, with no missing values.

3. Model Building and Evaluation
We trained four different classification models:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree Classifier

All models were trained on an 80-20 train-test split.
Accuracy Results:

SVM: 100%

KNN: 100%

Logistic Regression: ~97%

Decision Tree: ~97%

Confusion matrices showed near-perfect classification. Most misclassifications (if any) happened between Versicolor and Virginica.

4. Future Scope
The project can be improved and extended by:

Adding hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Using ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

Validating performance with k-fold cross-validation.

Deploying the model with a web interface using Flask or Streamlit.

Including image-based iris data and testing deep learning models like CNNs.

5. Conclusion
The Iris dataset is a classic, simple problem to demonstrate supervised machine learning techniques.
This project successfully showed that:

Proper data visualization helps understand data patterns.

SVM and KNN performed best, achieving 100% accuracy on test data.

With basic preprocessing and simple models, highly accurate results are achievable.

This project is an ideal example for beginners to learn the end-to-end machine learning pipeline: preprocessing, EDA, model building, evaluation, and reporting.
